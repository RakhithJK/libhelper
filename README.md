# libhelper

Library for assisting my other projects. Includes / will include support for parsing ASN1 and MachO files, reading and writing files, an error system etc.

libhelper is designed for my own projects, but can easily be used by anyone else. It's design is modular, so add as a git submodule and compile whatever parts are required for your project.
